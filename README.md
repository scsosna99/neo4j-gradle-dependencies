# neo4j-gradle-dependencies
Load dependency tree generated by Gradle into a Neo4J database.

# Requirements
Neo4J Community Server (free) or Neo4J Enterprise Service (licensed)

# Steps

### Mapping File
The mapping file specifies a partial groupId and maps it to an artifact type that will be assigned to each Neo4J node.  The mapping is a property assignment.

The artifact type is determined when the artifact's groupId starts with the partial specified in the mapping file.  The mappings are processed in order and terminates once a match is found.

More specified (longer, more parts) must be specified before a related but less specific (shorter, less parts) to be correctly processed.

### Generate dependencies via Gradle
<i>./gradle dependencies [--configuration &lt;compileClasspath | runtimeClasspath | testCompileClasspath | testRuntimeClasspath]</i>

The loader only processes these common Gradle configurations.  However, additional classparts can be recognized by modifying the <b>ConfigurationType</b enum

### Run the loader
<i>DependencyLoader &lt;file-name | directory-name&gt; [&lt;mapping-file&gt;] </i>

When a directory name is provided, all files in the directory are processed in one run.

While technically optional, providing a custom mapping file provides better visualization of the different types of artifacts.

# Notes
Currently the Neo4J database is purged before each run.
